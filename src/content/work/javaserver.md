### About
This is a simple HTTP 1.1 server that serves a static web page. It is written in Java and uses the following dependencies, managed by Maven:

    Jackson Core: a JSON parser and generator for Java
    Jackson Databind: a library for binding JSON data to Java objects (using Jackson Core)
    SLF4J API: a logging facade for various logging frameworks, allowing for simple configuration and switching between implementations
    Logback Classic: a logging framework compatible with SLF4J, featuring fast and flexible configuration options
    JUnit Jupiter: a unit testing framework for Java, featuring new features and extensions over the previous JUnit versions.
