### About

DVDream 95 is designed emulate the old-fashioned DVD screensavers that were popular during the late 90s and early 2000s, transporting users back to the days of Windows 95 with a Vaporwave soundtrack and nostalgic VCR effects. The animation was created in JavaScript, and the frame itself was built using HTML and this [great CSS framework](https://github.com/torch2424/aesthetic-css).
